# Angular Fundamentals Seed

This project is based off the [Angular Fundamentals](https://ultimateangular.com/courses/#angular-2) course by [Todd Motto](https://twitter.com/toddmotto).
I am using this as a training ground to understand the fundamentals of Angular

## Project Tooling

The project uses `webpack` to build and compile all of our assets. This will do the following for us: 

- Compile all our TypeScript code into JavaScript (starting from `main.ts` and branching outwards from imported files)
- Bundle all our JavaScript into one file to use
- Allow us to use SASS for our component's CSS files
- Provide the polyfills needed to run our app in all modern browsers
- Mock a JSON backend using [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
